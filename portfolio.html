        <p class="item">In this project my team and I were tasked with designing a creative packaging solution that would protect a glass fishtank during ISTA 3A distribution testing. The project could use plastic materials but their use was discouraged. We came up with a cubic design that attempted to have corrugated board act as a cushion, similar to how polymer foams do. While we did survive testing, we had many improvements we would make to the design.</p>

        <p class="item">In this proejct my team and I were tasked with creating a completely original mars candy multipack, and then designing trays and an entire palletized display to display them in the store. The tray had to be modular and work on both the display and alone on the shelf. We did all of the work, from packaging design to ASTM D4169 testing, to graphics and a final assembly.</p>

        <p class="imagereplacer">Sorry Dr. Lindgren, I was intending to put pictures on here and then forgot I'm under NDA not to reveal anything until June 1st. The issue of working with people from the industry I guess. Just imagine there are pictures of a palletized display here.</p>
