            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Benjamin Sammons, I am a recent graduate of Virginia Tech with a Bacehlors in Packaging Systems and Design and a minor in Professional and Technical Writing. I have a lot of experience with Packaging Design and Distribution Packaging and hope to move into either the field of Logistics, Distribution, or Unit Load Design. I also have experience with Supply Chain and Bussiness concepts. In my minor I learned valuable lessons in clarity, style, audience analysis, and grammar usage that will be an asset in creating user friendly and easy to understand reports and presentations.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>On a more personal note, I have many hobbies outside of my professional aspirations. I am a big video game fan, with some of my favorite being Halo, Red Dead Redemption, and Borderlands. I enjoy watching movies and TV shows and spending time with my girlfriend. I play the guitar and the cello, albeit not that well, and hope to learn more instruments in the future. </p>
